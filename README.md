Do you need to reuse a bunch of logic between different projects testing
apps with [Cucumber] and [Thirtyfour]? This crate is for you.

Provides a `cucumber::World` builder that can be used to create a `World`
for thirtyfour tests, allowing to inject environment variables to
parametrize them.

- `BROWSER`: browser to use. Supported are `firefox`, `chrome`, and `edge`.
- `HEADLESS`: by default, tests are executed in headless mode. Set this
  to `false` to run them in a visible browser.
- `WINDOW_SIZE`: size of the browser window. The default is `1920x1080`.
- `HOST_URL`: base URL of the application under test. The default is
  `http://localhost:8080`.
- `DRIVER_URL`: the URL of the WebDriver server. The default is
  `http://localhost:4444`.

## Usage

Create a crate and add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
cucumber = "0.21"
thirtyfour = "0.35"
cucumber-thirtyfour-worlder = "0.1"
```

Inside, create your `AppWorld` struct and pass it the `#[worlder]` attribute.

```rust
use cucumber_thirtyfour_worlder::worlder;

#[worlder]
pub struct AppWorld;
```

Then, create a crate for tests and run the world as you would do with
`cucumber::World` directly.

```rust
use your_crate::AppWorld;
use cucumber::World;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    AppWorld::cucumber()
        .fail_on_skipped()
        .run_and_exit("./features/desktop")
        .await
}
```

Start a webdriver server before running the tests.

```sh
chromedriver --port=4444
# or `geckodriver --port=4444` (for Firefox)
# or `msedgedriver --port=4444` (for MsEdge)
```

And run your tests passing a browser in the `BROWSER` environment variable.

```sh
BROWSER=chrome cargo test --package your-crate --test desktop -- --fail-fast
```

Where `desktop` is the name of your test file and `your-crate` is the name of
the crate that contains the `AppWorld` struct.

## Known issues

### `cargo-machete` additional configuration

The [`cargo-machete`] tool don't know that you're not using `cucumber` and
`thirtyfour`, so it could complain about missing dependencies.
To fix this, add the following to your _Cargo.toml_.

```toml
[package.metadata.cargo-machete]
ignored = ["thirtyfour", "cucumber"]
```
